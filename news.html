      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate yet unexperienced software developer looking to gain experience and help provide technical solutions.</p>
      <p>I have a strong background in Java and have worked on various projects that showcase my skills in agile team development and TDD solo development methologies. I am 	skilled in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as backend development with Java and the ASP.net framework, and mobile application 	development with Android studio. I will also be providing IOS application development soon!</p>
     <br>
      <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, working overnight as a stocker at walmart, or outside workingout. I'm interested in leveraging 	technology to create innovative, minimalistic, and user-friendly solutions.</p>
      <p>Feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries or opportunities. I'm open to collaborations, freelance work, or full-time positions.</p>
