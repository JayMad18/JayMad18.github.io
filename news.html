      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate yet unexperienced software developer looking to gain experience and help provide technical solutions.</p>
      <p>I have a strong background in Java and have worked on various projects that showcase my skills in agile team development and TDD solo development methologies. I am 	skilled in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as backend development with Java and the ASP.net framework, and mobile application 	development with Android studio. I will also be providing IOS application development soon!</p>
     <br>
      <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, working overnight as a stocker at walmart, or outside workingout. I'm interested in leveraging 	technology to create innovative, minimalistic, and user-friendly solutions.</p>
      <p>Feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries or opportunities. I'm open to collaborations, freelance work, or full-time positions.</p>
	<h2>HealthyHome</h2>
     	 <p>For those of you who helped me test the alpha version of HealthyHome I really appreciate you guys so much! <br> I have recently unpublished HealthyHome from the 	android playstore because I am now working on releasing the full version this fall! <br>The full version will have multiple features that was not usable on the alpha 	version as well as faster and smoother functionality. If you would like to be notified when HealthyHome is released just go to my contact page, <br>list your email 	and in the message box put "HealthyHome" and I will add your email to my list of the first people to notifiy!</p>
